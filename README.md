# ACF-Strategic-Philanthropy

## 1. Background and Overview
This project was developed to assist Lee, a CSR Manager for a large Australian company, who is focused on making **strategic philanthropic investments**. Lee's goal is to align her company’s funding with specific values, such as **youth leadership**, and with global initiatives like the **UN Sustainable Development Goals** (SDGs). She needs a more effective way to identify potential partners and opportunities.

Lee discovered the **Australian Communities Foundation** (ACF), a platform that lists numerous projects seeking support. However, she required a clearer, more interactive way to analyze this data. This project was initiated to answer three key questions that define her strategic needs:

1. What are the characteristics of the organisations and projects seeking funding?

2. Where can Lee prioritize funding for maximum SDG impact in Australia?

3. Which ACF charities align best with addressing critical youth well-being challenges?

## 2. Executive Summary
This data analysis project provides Lee with a powerful, data-driven framework for making strategic funding decisions. The core deliverable is an interactive tool that transforms complex data from the Australian Communities Foundation (ACF) into clear, actionable insights.

The project empowers Lee to move beyond reactive giving and make proactive investments by:

- Providing a complete overview of the philanthropic landscape on the ACF platform.

- Highlighting opportunities to maximize the company's impact on Australia's SDG status.

- Pinpointing charities that are most aligned with her company's specific focus on youth well-being.

Ultimately, the project equips Lee with the insights and evidence needed to allocate her company's philanthropic resources effectively, ensuring every investment generates measurable social returns.

## 3. Insights Deep Dive
**Question 1: What are the characteristics of the organisations and projects seeking funding?**

The ACF platform features 423 charities and 109 ongoing projects seeking over $10.64M in funding. Critically for Lee's goals, only 17.5% of projects are **youth-focused**. Most charities are concentrated in NSW and Victoria, with funding heavily directed toward social purpose and education. Small charities tend to focus on poverty, while large ones prioritize health.

**Question 2: Where can Lee prioritise funding for maximum SDG impact in Australia?**

A comparison of Australia’s SDG status and ACF's focus reveals two key opportunities. Lee can fund overlooked national priorities like **Goal 13** (Climate Action), which has a severe shortage of funding. Alternatively, she can support systemic change in popular areas like **Goal 4** (Quality Education) by funding large-scale solutions to complex, systemic challenges.

**Question 3: Which charity organisations demonstrate the strongest alignment with youth well-being?**

An interactive tool allows Lee to precisely identify organizations aligned with her needs. She can dynamically filter by **Field of Interest, Target Population, and UN SDGs** to find charities focused on youth well-being. This feature provides a detailed overview of potential partners and their projects, enabling a strategic, data-driven approach to funding.

## 4. Recommendations
Based on the project's insights, the following actions are recommended for Lee:

- Utilize the Interactive Tool: Use the provided dashboard to filter for projects that align with her specific criteria for youth and SDG support.

- Prioritize Strategic Gaps: Consider allocating funds to under-represented SDGs, such as Climate Action (Goal 13), to make a high-impact contribution in an underfunded area.

- Support Systemic Change: For more common SDGs, fund organizations that are developing innovative, large-scale solutions to create lasting change.

- Adopt a Pilot Program Strategy: Use the tool's project-level detail to fund smaller projects as pilots to gauge their social impact before committing to long-term partnerships.
