# ACF-Strategic-Philanthropy

## 1. Background and Overview
This project was developed to assist Lee, a CSR Manager for a large Australian company, who is focused on making **strategic philanthropic investments**. Lee's goal is to align her company’s funding with specific values, such as **youth leadership**, and with global initiatives like the **UN Sustainable Development Goals** (SDGs). She needs a more effective way to identify potential partners and opportunities.

Lee discovered the **Australian Communities Foundation** (ACF), a platform that lists numerous projects seeking support. However, she required a clearer, more interactive way to analyze this data. This project was initiated to answer three key questions that define her strategic needs:

1. What are the characteristics of the organisations and projects seeking funding?

2. Where can Lee prioritize funding for maximum SDG impact in Australia?

3. Which ACF charities align best with addressing critical youth well-being challenges?

## 2. Executive Summary
This data analysis project provides Lee with a powerful, data-driven framework for making strategic funding decisions. The core deliverable is an interactive tool that transforms complex data from the Australian Communities Foundation (ACF) into clear, actionable insights.

The project empowers Lee to move beyond reactive giving and make proactive investments by:

- Providing a complete overview of the philanthropic landscape on the ACF platform.

- Highlighting opportunities to maximize the company's impact on Australia's SDG status.

- Pinpointing charities that are most aligned with her company's specific focus on youth well-being.

Ultimately, the project equips Lee with the insights and evidence needed to allocate her company's philanthropic resources effectively, ensuring every investment generates measurable social returns.

## 3. Insights Deep Dive
Initial insights reveal significant disparities in supplier performance and category health:

### Supplier Performance
**Supplier A:** Excels in inventory control with the lowest back order rate but requires immediate action to address a declining perfect order rate and increasing lead time variability.

**Supplier B:** Shows strong improvement in perfect order rate and lead times but is hindered by the highest transportation costs.

**Supplier C:** Maintains moderate back order rates and steadily improves perfect order accuracy, indicating reliable overall performance.

**Supplier D:** Delivers excellent perfect order rates and stable lead times but struggles with a persistently high back order rate, suggesting potential issues in demand planning or stock allocation.

### Category Performance
**Furniture:** High inventory turnover and low average COGS, particularly driven by Supplier C, position this category as a strong profit generator.

**Clothing:** Low turnover and high COGS, combined with overstocking and forecasting issues, present significant operational challenges.

**Electronics:** Benefiting from Supplier A’s stable lead times and low COGS, this category shows promising performance potential.

**Accessories:** Balanced performance from Suppliers B and D, maintaining acceptable cost and lead time levels.


## 5. Recommendations
Based on these insights, targeted recommendations are proposed:

### Supplier-Specific Recommendations
**Supplier A:** Prioritize resolution of declining perfect order rates and rising lead times to restore consistency and service quality.

**Supplier B:** Continue improvements in order accuracy and lead time reduction while implementing cost optimization strategies to reduce transportation expenses.

**Supplier C:** Strengthen efforts to improve perfect order accuracy further and explore opportunities to enhance cost efficiency.

**Supplier D:** Address high back order rates through improved forecasting and inventory planning to leverage strong operational capabilities fully.

### Category-Specific
**Furniture:** Expand product offerings to meet growing demand and strengthen relationships with key suppliers (particularly Supplier C) to secure favorable terms.

**Clothing:** Implement advanced, data-driven forecasting models incorporating market trends and seasonal factors. Prioritize sourcing from suppliers with lower COGS and reduced lead time variability to minimize excess inventory and control costs.

**Electronics & Accessories:** Maintain current sourcing strategies while exploring further opportunities to improve cost efficiency and supply stability.

## 6. Impact Summary
Based on historical performance data and industry benchmarks, the proposed improvements are estimated to increase perfect order rates by up to 15%, reduce transportation costs by approximately 10–12%, and significantly strengthen overall supply chain resilience (e.g., more stable lead times and fewer stockouts).
